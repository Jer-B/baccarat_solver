## System Overview

### The Problem with Traditional Systems

**❌ What Was Wrong Before:**

1. **Showing Specific Cards**: Traditional systems would show "8S, 9S, JC" when burning cards randomly
2. **Unrealistic Information**: In real casinos, you NEVER know what was burned
3. **Inconsistent Integration**: Burn analysis wasn't properly integrated with Kelly Criterion and Monte Carlo
4. **Missing Professional Algorithms**: No implementation of proven advantage play methods
5. **No Dealer Tell Recognition**: Missing critical observational capabilities
6. **No Team Coordination**: Single-observer limitations
7. **No Machine Learning**: Static analysis without adaptation

### ✅ Professional Solution

The new system tracks that "something was burned" without revealing what, then uses professional algorithms enhanced with dealer tell recognition, team play coordination, and machine learning to estimate the impact.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Unknown Burn Tracking
```typescript
// Professional approach - tracks unknown burns
burnUnknownCards(count: number): void {
  // Track that cards were burned without knowing what they were
  const unknownBurn: Card = {
    rank: 'UNKNOWN' as any, // Explicitly unknown
    suit: 'UNKNOWN' as any, // Explicitly unknown
    value: -1 as any, // Explicitly unknown
    isBurned: true,
    isUnknownBurn: true, // Key flag for professional tracking
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    handNumber: this.history.currentHandNumber,
  };
}
```

#### 2. Strategic Value Calculation

**Strategic Value** indicates the importance of burn card analysis:

- **"Standard"**: Normal game conditions (>52 cards remaining)
- **"HIGH (End of Shoe)"**: Critical analysis phase (<52 cards remaining)

The strategic value increases exponentially as the shoe depletes because:
- Fewer unknown cards make estimates more accurate
- Each burned card has greater impact on remaining probabilities
- End-of-shoe scenarios offer the highest advantage potential

## Professional Algorithms

### 1. Jacobson Method

**Source**: Eliot Jacobson's "Advanced Advantage Play"

**Methodology**: Statistical analysis based on casino burn procedures and empirical frequency data

**Key Features**:
- Creates multiple scenarios based on typical casino burn counts (3-7 cards)
- Weights scenarios based on real casino frequency data
- Most casinos burn 4-5 cards (60% probability)
- Accounts for dealer variation and casino policies

**Scenario Weighting**:
```
3 burns: 15% probability
4 burns: 25% probability
5 burns: 35% probability (most common)
6 burns: 20% probability
7 burns: 5% probability
```

**Status Indicators**:
- **"Active"**: When unknown burns are present
- **"Standby"**: No unknown burns to analyze

### 2. Griffin Method

**Source**: Adapted from Peter Griffin's "The Theory of Blackjack"

**Methodology**: High vs low card bias analysis based on dealer behavior patterns

**Key Features**:
- Analyzes dealer tendency to burn high vs low cards
- Considers psychological factors in card selection
- Accounts for dealer training and habits
- Provides bias-adjusted probability estimates

**Bias Analysis**:
```
30% high card bias: 10% probability (conservative dealers)
40% high card bias: 20% probability
50% high card bias: 40% probability (neutral)
60% high card bias: 20% probability
70% high card bias: 10% probability (aggressive dealers)
```

**Status Indicators**:
- **"Active"**: When sufficient hand history exists (>2 hands)
- **"Learning"**: Building dealer behavior profile

### 3. Wong Method

**Source**: Stanford Wong's adaptive estimation research

**Methodology**: Pattern recognition system that adapts based on observed hand history

**Key Features**:

### 4. Bayesian Update Method

**Source**: Modern probabilistic analysis

**Methodology**: Updates prior estimates using Bayes' theorem as new evidence emerges

**Evidence Types**:
