Next once a bet is placed, I am able to select cards by clicking. 
but what will be the best is to be able to select cards by my keyboard. so just when pressing below keys (left side) I should be able to control the gaming sequence, if and only if, I am in the sequence where cards are selectable:
1 - As
2,3, 4,5,6,7,8,9 -> corresponding cards
0 -> 10
Q -> J
W -> Queen
E -> King 


When I am in the sequence where I can currently bet,
If possible Id like to add R as a key to clear hands / complete round ? 
P Key for player, B key for banker ?
T key for tie ?
A Key to validate the bet status to change into "currently betting" mode ?
