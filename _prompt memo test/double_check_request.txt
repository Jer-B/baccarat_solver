Now lets recheck if we have everything for game, history, settings pages base part before we start refactoring to add necessary section inside them. actual implementation and tests are good. just re re re check again for top-notch excellence level verification of our game, history, settings pages view base refactor, cypress settings, tests. Aim for Over Excellence level:

game, history, settings pages view base test coverage is over excellence ? (dont change how game, history, settings pages view base is and needs to be initialized for working with mock browser, unit, integration and e2e tests.)


Does tests here /Users/hei02/Desktop/Main/baccarat/improved_baccarat_assistant/tests are all good. do we have unit integration e2e tests there including mock browser with jsdom ?

does cypress tests about game, history, settings pages view base are all goods ? 
do all cypress tests passes ?
do we have cypress unit, integration, e2e test for game, history, settings pages view base refactor in cypress suite ?

files you created are complete at 100% ? no more improvement / enhancement required on them ?
Do they have unused stuff ?
Does our game, history, settings pages view base is adapted and using refactor changes adequatly at excellence level ?


Is there disabled tests ? if so, shouldnt they be re-verified ?


the whole game, history, settings pages view base refactor files are dry ?

Does files related to game, history, settings pages view base related files, use setup() and cleanup pattern instead of onmounted and onunmounted ?

Does events are well emitted and catch at parent level following right standards ?(if im not wrong about that standard)

I dont want things to be just production-ready with enterprise-level. i want things to be top-notch excellence level surpassing production-ready and enterprise-level levels. so be disciplined. Thats why i am just asking for double check as always.


## Excellence-Level Enhancement Request: game, history, settings pages view base

### Current State Analysis
Target: game, history, settings pages view base configuration and setup and integration
Reference: Theme system architecture (src/types/core/themeTypes.ts pattern)
Files: 
/Users/hei02/Desktop/Main/baccarat/improved_baccarat_assistant/src/views/CDDMainContainer.vue

Goal: Same excellence level as theme system

### Excellence-Level Requirements
- **Reference Architecture**: "Apply the same excellence-level patterns used in the theme system"
- **Maintainability**: "Ensure junior AND senior developer friendly"
- **Type Safety**: "100% TypeScript strict mode, zero `any` types"
- **Error Handling**: "Comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms"
- **Performance**: "Optimized reactive patterns and memory management"
- **Over excellence**: vite/vue JSDOM tests, e2e, unit, integration + cypress unit, integration, e2e tests suites implementation

### Specific Enhancements Needed
1. **Type System**: [Centralized types like theme system]
2. **Validation**: [Zod schemas like theme validation]  
3. **Error Handling**: [Advanced error handling like theme errors]
4. **Architecture**: [Clean separation like theme architecture]
5. **Integration**: [Seamless integration like theme integration]

### Reference Files (Theme System Examples)
- **Types Structure**: `src/types/core/themeTypes.ts`
- **Validation Pattern**: `src/utils/validation/themeValidation.ts`
- **Error Handling**: `src/utils/errors/themeErrorHandler.ts`
- **Store Pattern**: `src/stores/themeStore.ts`
- **Composable Pattern**: `src/composables/useTheme.ts`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero unused imports/code
- [ ] Single source of truth for all types
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with recovery
- [ ] Performance optimized patterns
- [ ] Junior developer friendly structure
- [ ] Senior developer advanced features
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] Extensible architecture ready for future growth
