## Database Setup

This application uses Supabase for data persistence. Follow the comprehensive setup guide:

**ðŸ“– [Supabase Setup Guide](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md)**

The database provides:

- **Persistent Game Sessions**: Save and resume baccarat games
- **Hand History**: Complete tracking of all hands played
- **Burned Card Analysis**: Store and analyze burned cards impact
- **Edge Calculation History**: Track edge calculations over time
- **Pattern Analysis**: Historical pattern recognition and trends

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Configure the number of decks (6 or 8)
2. Set the cut card position
3. Enable desired tracking features

### Tracking Burned Cards

1. Enable "Track Burned Cards" in settings
2. Input burned cards as they occur
3. Monitor the impact on edge calculations

### Pattern Analysis

1. Enable "Show Pattern Analysis" in settings
2. Input hand results to build pattern history
3. View streak analysis and trends

### Edge Sorting

1. Enable "Edge Sorting" in settings
2. Mark cards as high/low based on orientation
3. Monitor edge sorting advantage

## Mathematical Background

### Edge Calculations

The application uses precise mathematical formulas to calculate house edges:

- **Player Bet**: Standard edge of -1.06%
- **Banker Bet**: Standard edge of -1.06% (including commission)
- **Tie Bet**: Standard edge of -14.36%
- **Pair Bets**: Standard edge of -10.76%

These edges are dynamically adjusted based on:

- Burned card composition
- Cut card position
- Edge sorting information

### Burned Card Impact

The system tracks burned cards and calculates their impact using:

- Hypergeometric distribution for probability adjustments
- Confidence levels based on sample size
- Estimated impact on each bet type

### Pattern Analysis

Statistical analysis includes:

- Streak identification and analysis
- Chopping pattern recognition
- Alternating pattern detection
- Conditional probability calculations
